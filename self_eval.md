# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
**I feel fairly confident in why and how to use methods. It's an excellent shortcut for routine requests that we may need when writing code. I also feel relatively confident that I know where I can look to find if a built in method exsists.**
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
**I feel confident that I can write simple methods and return the desired results. I also feel that if I am not getting the output desired, that I can diagnos the issue either from the output error or with a google search.**
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
**I want to know what the most common pitfall of writing and using methods is when beginning to write more complex code lines. Are there common places where student become hung up as complexity grows.**
